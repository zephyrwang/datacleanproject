col	variable
1	person: the volunteer ID in this experiment, ranging from 1 to 30
2	activity_num: activity ID performed by the subject, ranging from 1 to 6.
3	activity: activity in descriptive names
	
The other variables are averages of features about mean and standard deviation measurements per person per activity.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz 
to remove noise. 
	
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and 
tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
	
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ 
and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
	
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial 
signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation
	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
	
All these below variables range from -1 to 1.
